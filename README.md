# Titanic Data Analysis

This project analyzes the Titanic passenger dataset to uncover insights about survival rates and the factors that influenced them. The analysis is performed in a Jupyter Notebook using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

---

## Dataset

The dataset (`titanic.csv`) contains information about Titanic passengers, including:
- PassengerId
- Survived (target variable)
- Pclass (ticket class)
- Name
- Sex
- Age
- SibSp (siblings/spouses aboard)
- Parch (parents/children aboard)
- Ticket
- Fare
- Cabin
- Embarked (port of embarkation)

---

## Project Structure

- `titanic.csv` — The dataset file.
- `Titanic_Analysis.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook with data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and insights.
- `README.md` — Project overview and instructions.

---

## How to Run

1. **Clone or download this repository.**
2. **Install the required Python libraries:**
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. **Open `Titanic_Analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.**
4. **Run the notebook cells to see the analysis and visualizations.**

---

## Key Analysis Steps

- Data cleaning (handling missing values)
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualization of survival rates by sex, class, age, fare, and family size
- Correlation analysis
